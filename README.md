# Clickable-FC3Eagle

A partially clickable cockpit mod for the F-15C in DCS World.

This is a fork from RedK0d's great work to add animations and clickable cockpits for FC3 aircraft. My group flies the F-15C exclusively, so I've focused this fork specifically on the Eagle.

Thanks to RedK0d for the original work: https://github.com/RedK0d/CLICKABLE-FC3
