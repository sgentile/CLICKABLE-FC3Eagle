# Clickable-FC3Eagle
 This is a fork from RedK0d's great work to add animations and clickable cockpits for some of the DCS World FC3 modules.   The project was mostly abandoned and my group flies the F-15C exclusively so I wanted to pick this up and support it for the Eagle.   Thanks for RedK0d for starting this and providing the open source code for it !
